// Fibbonacci Number
/*
Problem Description
Given a positive integer A, write a program to find the Ath Fibonacci number.
In a Fibonacci series, each term is the sum of the previous two terms and the first two terms of the series are 0 and 1. i.e. f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1. Hence, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 2, f(4) = 3 and so on.
NOTE: 0th term is 0. 1th term is 1 and so on.

Problem Constraints
0 <= A <= 44

Input Format
First and only argument is an integer A.

Output Format
Return an integer denoting the Ath Fibonacci number.

Example Input
Input 1:
 A = 4
Input 2:
 A = 6
Example Output
Output 1:
 3
Output 2:
 8

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 Terms of Fibonacci series are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 and so on.
 0th term is 0 So, 4th term of Fibonacci series is 3. 
Explanation 2:
 6th term of Fibonacci series is 8.
